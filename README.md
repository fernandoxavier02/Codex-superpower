# Codex Superpower

This repository is a Codex adaptation of the original [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) project for Claude Code.

The goal here is not to replace or rebrand the original work. It is to preserve the same workflow structure, skills philosophy, and overall operating model from the Claude plugin, while adapting the runtime, hooks, commands, and global wiring so the system behaves correctly inside Codex.

Original Superpowers for Claude was created by Jesse Vincent and the team at Prime Radiant. The Codex adaptation, global integration, hook enforcement, and workflow-porting work in this repository were implemented by Fernando Xavier at FX Studio AI.

## About Superpowers

Superpowers is a complete software development workflow for your coding agents, built on top of a set of composable "skills" and some initial instructions that make sure your agent uses them.

## How it works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. 

Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. 

After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY. 

Next up, once you say "go", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Superpowers.

## Installation

**Note:** Installation differs by platform. Claude Code or Cursor have built-in plugin marketplaces. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.

### Claude Code Official Marketplace

Superpowers is available via the [official Claude plugin marketplace](https://claude.com/plugins/superpowers)

Install the plugin from Claude marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
```

### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Claude Code, register the marketplace first:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
```

Then install the plugin from this marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

### Cursor (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Cursor Agent chat, install from marketplace:

```text
/add-plugin superpowers
```

or search for "superpowers" in the plugin marketplace.

### Codex

Tell Codex:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.codex.md](docs/README.codex.md)

### OpenCode

Tell OpenCode:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/obra/superpowers
```

To update:

```bash
gemini extensions update superpowers
```

### Verify Installation

Start a new session in your chosen platform and ask for something that should trigger a skill (for example, "help me plan this feature" or "let's debug this issue"). The agent should automatically invoke the relevant superpowers skill.

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.

4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality), or executes in batches with human checkpoints.

5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## What's Inside
